How to use the CandlesMedievalStandard pack

1. When importing the pack for the first time, Unity will give some errors inside the console about the LOD's
	- just clear and ignore them; it's a personal choice of mine to export the LOD's individually and it doesn't affect the asset in any way (at least not from what I know of)

2. Some steps you need to take in order to make everything work:
- in Project Settings / Player / Rendering dropdown, change the Color Space to Linear
- In Project Settings / Quality / Other, change the Lod Bias to 3. If you don't want to change this due to your other props LOD's, just change the LOD's distances of the prefabs
- install the post processing stack v2 from the Window / Package manager


3. The texture ps_candle_flame_1_AB and the camera controller are used from the Unity Particle Pack that is free
