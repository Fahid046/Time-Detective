# Time-Detective
## A cat-and-mouse game involving a time-traveling art thief
### Initial steps:
- Clone & store it in an easy-to-access folder
- In your IDE, pull from main / latest updated branch depending on updates
- Open that folder in Unity
- Make a change in the scene, click save file & save the project to see if your IDE tracks that change
- For Unity editor, remember to download 2022.3.8f1 and to download the Android export module
- When committing, if you see a DS_store change, discard that file and don't commit it because the metadata causes merge conflicts

- It's also a 3D URP project, you can follow [this](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/create-a-vr-starter-project-from-scratch#62a2a478edbc2a0eaaf89a4b) to figure out what you need to import/get initially. Probably not going to be needed if the clone already receives this by default though.
